## Project Summary

Our database is designed to serve for a comprehensive music rating and discovery website. The core functionality of the platform allows users to rate their own music collections, including albums and tracks, providing a personalized music review experience. In addition to its rating features, the website offers robust search capabilities, allowing users to explore and discover albums and artists across various genres and eras. Besides, our website also incorporates a sophisticated recommendation system, which takes the user experience to the next level by personalizing music discovery based on individual preferences. Once users have rated a sufficient number of albums and tracks, and curated a list of their favorite music, the system employs algorithms to analyze their tastes and preferences.
